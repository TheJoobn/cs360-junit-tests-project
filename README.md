I implemented unit testing, input validation, and structured error handling to ensure functionality and security. JUnit tests help verify expected behavior and validation techniques prevent common security vulnerabilities. Understanding user needs involves analyzing requirements and incorporating feedback. In my projects, I enforced constraints like unique IDs and field validation to ensure data integrity and meet user expectations. I follow a modular, scalable, and maintainable design approach, using object-oriented principles and test-driven development. The Contact Service project, for instance, follows a clear separation of concerns, making future modifications easier.
